**This project was made to demonstrate the power of computer vision in creating fun and interactive applications.**

## Key features of the project
1. **Color detection** → Uses OpenCV's HSV color space to detect the color selected by the user in the webcam feed
2. **Interactive Color Palette** → On screen color palette lets user choose their preferred drawing color or activate eraser mode, the selection can be done by hovering user's pen above the desired color
3. **Real-time drawing** → Creates a seamless drawing experience by overlaying the drawings made by the user to the webcam feed
4. **Color Selector** → Users can choose the color they want the program detect as a pen in the webcam by using the color selector tool
5. **Canvas Management** → Drawn content is stored on a dedicated canvas (which is different from the webcam feed) to create a smooth drawing and erasing experience
